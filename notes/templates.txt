:: Command Templates ::

> If the command has subcommands, you will need to add this method:
@Override
public boolean executeCommand(final IMessage msg, final String[] tokens, final int tokDepth) {
  if (!super.executeCommand(msg, tokens, tokDepth)) {
    [COMMAND BODY -- Executes if there are no sub-commands]
  }  
  return RBCommand.STOP_CMD_SEARCH;
}

> If the command does not have subcommands, you use this one:
@Override
public boolean executeCommand(final IMessage msg, final String[] tokens, final int tokDepth) {
  [COMMAND BODY -- Executes unconditionally]
  return RBCommand.STOP_CMD_SEARCH;
}
